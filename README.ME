This repo is a project to show what I have learned from TOP so far.
By completing this project I will have shown basic understanding of using command line,
vscode, and basic HTML concepts. Concepts will include creating a boilermaker, 
understanding of meta tags, syntax, organization, structure, and other things I cant think
of right now. far
